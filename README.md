Automatic Street Light Control System

The project introduces an innovative Automatic Street Light Control System, focusing on efficient energy management and enhanced safety in urban environments. This system utilizes IoT technology to automate street lighting based on ambient light levels, ensuring optimal illumination while conserving energy.

Hardware components include the ESP8266 NodeMCU, light sensors, and solid-state relays for seamless control. A reliable power source, such as a 3.7V Lithium-ion battery or solar panel, ensures continuous operation without interruption.

Project Setup:

The system employs real-time data from light sensors to dynamically adjust street light brightness according to environmental conditions. During daylight, street lights dim or turn off to conserve energy. As darkness falls, the system activates street lights to provide adequate illumination for pedestrians and vehicles.
